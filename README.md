# Cypress CI Project

Example repo to showcase how to integrate cypress tests to CircleCI

## Getting Started

Run `npm i` to install project dependencies.

To run all tests (just the Cypress example tests for demo), run the command `npm test` which would also generate a Cypress test report to be used with Mochawesome.
